        As an experienced Full Stack Engineer with over 6 years of professional
        experience, I specialize in web development and have a proven track
        record of delivering high-quality software solutions. My journey in the
        tech industry has led me to work on diverse projects, ranging from
        developing a sentiment analysis web application using social network
        data to building an innovative investment dashboard for iCapital, where
        I currently contribute my expertise.

        One of my recent accomplishments includes collaborating with a fellow
        engineer to develop an MVP for an AI chat system. This system stands out
        for its ability to integrate documents into its context, thereby
        enhancing its understanding and response to user queries.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technical skill set, coupled with my passion for problem-solving and
        team collaboration, makes me a valuable asset to any team seeking a
        dedicated and skilled Full Stack Engineer.
